Finally.

I've been intending to use this domain for a techie/geeky/whatever blog for a while. I bounced around from CMS to CMS before trying a few static site generators... [Sculpin](//sculpin.io) won me over. What's not to like about writing in [Markdown](//daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) and templating with [Twig](//twig.sensiolabs.org)?

This year I've been working on improving my coding skills. I finally started using [Composer](//getcomposer.org). I learned how to use [SASS](//sass-lang.com). I even taught myself a little Python.

I'm just amazed at where I am today. I started developing websites as a preteen when I was into roleplaying and pixel art. I probably started learning PHP in around 2007. PHP has been around for 20 years and I've been using it for 8. Here's to many more.
